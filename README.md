# Mastermind Solver Algorithms

This code aims to solve a game of mastermind in the least amount of atempts and under 10 seconds.
The code takes two parameters into account: how many numbers does the code contains (1 to 15) and the amount of combinations a number can have (1 to 15).
A report is included as part of the project to explain the different algorithms used (3 of them), why they are used and why they are the most efficient algorithm in every situation.

Note: this code uses basic algorithms simply using regular code and could be improved by using machine learning
